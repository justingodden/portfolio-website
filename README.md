# JG Portfolio Website

Simple, clean personal portfolio built using ReactJS to act as a hub for all of my personal projects, with scope to expand to other features such as incorporating a blog.

The site uses react-router and Material-ui and is hosted on GitHub Pages with a custom domain. The site is entirely responsive with a mobile-first design.
